# Number Two
[Number Two](https://2.exegete.me/) is a companion app I made for my Twitch channel. I liked it enough that I thought, "Why not make it available for others?"

At the moment, the following things work:

Chat overlay with Twitch emotes and user avatars.
!ask command for asking questions.
!todo for adding todos and showing a current todo overlay.
